The task is to implement a controller to get the Frank-Emicka Panda robot to pick up the blocks and place it in the bowl.
A resolved rate controller is used to perform this task. Null space optimization is utilized to maintain the robot's posture and gravity compensation is used to allow for self-balancing of the robot.
The notebook ```project.ipynb``` should be run in order to simulate the task using ```pybullet``` and obtain the trajectory plots using ```matplotlib```
